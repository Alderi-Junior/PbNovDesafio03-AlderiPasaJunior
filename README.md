 # Compass Microservices Project

![Badge Status](http://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=STATUS&message=FINISH&color=GREEN&style=for-the-badge)

This is a microservices project developed with Java and Spring Boot. It consists of two main microservices: ms-event-manager and ms-ticket-manager. The project leverages RabbitMQ for message queuing and integrates with external APIs using OpenFeign.
## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a microservices architecture using Spring Boot (version 3.3.x LTS). It includes:

ms-event-manager: Manages event-related operations.

ms-ticket-manager: Handles ticket management.

RabbitMQ: Facilitates communication between microservices through a message queue.

MongoDB Compass: Used as the database, with the following databases:

db_event

db_ticket

External API Consumption: ViaCEP API integration using OpenFeign.

AWS Services: EC2, VPC, Security Groups.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps:

1. Requirements:

- Java 17+
- Maven 3.8+
- RabbitMQ
- MongoDB Compass
  
2. Create the following databases in PostgreSQL:

- db_event
- db_ticket

3. Running the Microservices:
- Open the project and navigate to each microservice module.

- Run the Spring Boot applications individually using Maven or your IDE.

4. Running Tests

- The project includes unit tests with a minimum 80% line coverage.

- Run tests using:

- mvn test

üì° Messaging & API Integration

- RabbitMQ is used for asynchronous messaging between microservices.

- OpenFeign is used as an HTTP client for external API communication (e.g., ViaCEP for address lookup).

üöÄ Deployment

- The microservices can be deployed on AWS using EC2.

- VPC and Security Groups are configured for secure networking.

RabbitMQ and MongoDB can be hosted in a cloud environment or run locally.
